# Basic Combinatorics Exercises & Solutions

**Welcome to the Basic Combinatorics Exercises & Solutions repository!**

This repository contains a collection of exercises and solutions for anyone who wants to learn and practice combinatorics. Basic combinatorics is an important topic in mathematics that deals with counting and arranging objects.

## About the repository

Basic Combinatorics  course  cover and touch upon a variety of topics in Combinatorics, like Ramsey Theory, Extremal Graph Theory, Extremal Set Theory, the Partition Function and Enumerative Problems.
its also encounter a variety of tools and techniques, like Generating Functions, the Probabilistic
Method and tools from Linear Algebra . Each exercise includes a detailed solution with step-by-step explanations and examples. The solutions are written in LaTeX and can be downloaded from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/saarbk/Basic-Combinatorics).
